# Business Analysis: EPI vs Minimum Premium Variances  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project focuses on a reconciliation analysis between **Estimated Premium Income (EPI)** and **Minimum Premium (MINPREM)** datasets. The goal was to assess consistency across systems, evaluate the scale and distribution of variances, and uncover insights into the root causes of discrepancies.  

The project demonstrates skills in:  
- Business & financial data analysis  
- Variance analysis and reconciliation  
- Data visualization & dashboarding  
- Insights generation and recommendation reporting

- **Source:** Reconciliation spreadsheets provided for EPI and MINPREM  
- **Volume:** 181 records across multiple Business IDs and years  
- **Scope:** Comparative analysis between EPI-only variances and combined EPI & MINPREM variances  

---

## ðŸ”Ž Key Findings  
- **EPI Variances:** Small, stable, and clustered close to zero (~137.8M total variance; max deviation 13.7M).  
- **MINPREM Variances:** Significantly larger and systemic (~-1.59B total variance; max deviation 63.1M).  
- **Primary Contributors:** Specific years (2013, 2008, 2007) and selected Business IDs account for the bulk of reconciliation issues.  
- **Risk Insight:** MINPREM dominates >90% of mismatches, suggesting structural rather than random issues.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations & Dashboard

The analysis is supported by visual dashboards, including:  
- **Line Chart:** Trends of variances over time (showing EPI stability vs MINPREM volatility).  
- **Correlation Chart:** Relationship between EPI and MINPREM variances.  
- **Top 10 Variance Analysis:** Highlighting the largest discrepancies by year and Business ID.  

---

## âœ… Conclusion  
Discrepancies are primarily driven by **MINPREM**, with recurring systemic issues linked to certain years and Business IDs. In contrast, EPI remains consistent and low-risk for reconciliation. These findings highlight material risks to financial reporting if MINPREM processes are not corrected.  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations  
- **Targeted Root Cause Analysis** on high-variance years and Business IDs.  
- **System Review & Reconfiguration** for MINPREM calculation and data flow.  
- **Enhanced Data Controls & Alerts** for real-time variance detection.  
- **Governance & Automation** with reconciliation dashboards and automated checks.
